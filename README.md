```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/snowballbot.service

## üß† Tips

- Set a `custom nonce window` on Kraken to prevent `EAPI:Invalid nonce`
- Filter trades by 1-day window to ensure true cost basis
- Adjust RSI gates, slack, and grid width to match asset volatility
- Batch price updates via Coingecko every 30s‚Äì60s to avoid rate limits
